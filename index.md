    Words From The Team:
</h1>

```
    Jon: I've had the priviledge of working with Bradley for the last year and a half. I've watched him grow along with me, and can sy he's become an amazing friend. Best of luck buddy!

    Saad: Awesome mentor, always honest and geniune, plus respect for never doing a testing ticket :)
    
    Will: Thank you for being there when I asked 1000 questions in 30 seconds and answering them all while not getting annoyed at me. Your patience is from another world. There were times where you tanked through, even though I was at my wit's end. It has been a pleasure working with you these past few months and I wouldn't be at the level of comfort with Hangar today without you. Good luck with your next job! Team Annihilation is #1!
